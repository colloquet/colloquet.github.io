<p>On a web page, when the content is scrolling at a different speed from the background image, this causes a 3D effect which is refers to the “Parallax scrolling effect”. If you want to see it in action, head to <a href="http://colloque.me">homepage</a> and when you scroll, you can see the header’s contents is actually moving faster than the background image. Its a really subtle and cool effect. </p>

<p>When I was trying to implement this effect on my homepage, I found a lot of tutorials, while they produced the effect I was looking for, they were all laggy and making it a pain to scroll. Until I found this: <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/html5/smooth_parallax_scrolling.htm">Smooth Parallax Scrolling</a>. The tutorial clearly explain what parallax effect is and provide an excellent example for easy implementation. I am not going to copy and paste. Basically you can stop reading now and head to the tutorial. But I want to share a little tip that will make it even more awesome. </p>

<p>In the JavaScript code, there is a function called “setup” and within that, there are two lines that deal with the mouse wheel:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="c1">// deal with the mouse wheel</span>
<span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;mousewheel&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">mouseScroll</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;DOMMouseScroll&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">mouseScroll</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The purpose of the two lines is to control the scrolling speed and provide a consistent scrolling experience across multiple devices or OS. However, in my case, I didn’t like the scrolling speed so I simply commented out those two lines. Now I have a much better scrolling experience on my mac.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can edit the function “mouseScroll” located below “setup”. You will see the line: </p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="nx">mouseDelta</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">wheelDelta</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">120</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Change “120” to something like “50”, the smaller number gives you a faster scrolling speed.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
