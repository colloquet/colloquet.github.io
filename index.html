						<h1>Colloque Tsui

						</h1>
						<p>Hi there, I am a university student who is currently doing Master in IT at University of Aberdeen, Scotland. I got my Bachelor degree in Accounting and Finance at the same university in 2013. Before that, I finished my GCSE, AS-Level and A-Level exams at Methodist College Belfast, Northern Ireland. </p><p>I am very passionate about web design and during the course of my studies, <a href="http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/c.tsui.09/" target="top">my website</a> was awarded the Overall Winner. As well as web desgining, I also enjoy playing video games, Street Fighter 4 is my favourite game of all time!</p>
						<p>I made this website using HTML, CSS, <a href="http://jquery.com" target="top">JQuery</a>, JavaScript and some <a href="http://jquerymobile.com" target="top">JQuery mobile</a>. It has a responsive layout so it will adapt to your device's screen size, if you are visiting on a mobile phone, have a look at the desktop version and vice versa! Keep it Classy!</p>
